# weber-assembly
Logic gates simulated in javascript which work their way up to a MIPS32 computer.
Current Schematic: ![Schematic](/mipsSchematic01.png)
## includes
* The MIPS Computer currently supports machine code instructions for: add, sub, addi, and, or, ori, nor, slt, beq, lw, sw.
## coming soon
* Hazard Detection
* Support for more (although not all) [mips commands](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/resources/MIPS_Green_Sheet.pdf).
* Compilation of actual assembly code
* UI to write code and visualize the registers, and possibly a visualization of the computer.
* I think it would be cool to make my own computer, but I'm not sure whether I'll get to that.
